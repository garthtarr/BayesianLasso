# A better Bayesian Lasso

This package will grow over time. It currently includes functions for the 
Lasso Distribution.

The corresponding paper is [NOT YET] available on [arXiv]().

## Installation

The `BayesianLasso` package can be installed from GitHub using

```
remotes::install_github("garthtarr/BayesianLasso")
```

## Usage

### Lasso distribution
Normalizing constant Z, probability density function, cumulative distribution function,
quantile function, and random generation for the Lasso distribution with parameters \code{a}, \code{b}, and \code{c}.
In addition, Mills ratio, mean, and variance of the Lasso distribution are provided.
Coming soon.

### Bayesian Lasso

To see how this can be used to fit Bayesian Lasso models see the vignette.
