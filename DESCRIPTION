Description: Implements Bayesian Lasso regression using efficient Gibbs sampling
               algorithms, including modified versions of the Hans and Parkâ€“Casella (PC) samplers.
               Includes functions for working with the Lasso distribution, such as its density,
               cumulative distribution, quantile, and random generation functions, along with moment
               calculations. Also includes a function to compute the Mills ratio. Designed for sparse
               linear models and suitable for high-dimensional regression problems.
